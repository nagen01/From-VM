In organic chemistry alkane paraffin acyclic saturated hydrocarbon . In words alkane consists hydrogen carbon atoms arranged tree structure carbon–carbon bonds single . Alkanes general chemical formula CnH2n2 . The alkanes range complexity simplest case methane n 1 arbitrarily large complex molecules like pentacontane 6ethyl2methyl5 octane isomer tetradecane . IUPAC defines alkanes acyclic branched unbranched hydrocarbons general formula CnH2n2 therefore consisting entirely hydrogen atoms saturated carbon atoms . However sources use term denote saturated hydrocarbon including either monocyclic polycyclic despite different general formula . In alkane carbon atom sp3hybridized 4 sigma bonds hydrogen atom joined one carbon atoms . The longest series linked carbon atoms molecule known carbon skeleton carbon backbone . The number carbon atoms may considered size alkane . One group higher alkanes waxes solids standard ambient temperature pressure number carbon atoms carbon backbone greater 17 . With repeated –CH2 units alkanes constitute homologous series organic compounds members differ molecular mass multiples 14.03 u . Methane produced methanogenic bacteria longchain alkanes function pheromones certain animal species protective waxes plants fungi . Nevertheless alkanes much biological activity . They viewed molecular trees upon hung activereactive functional groups biological molecules . The alkanes two main commercial sources petroleum natural gas . An alkyl group alkanebased molecular fragment bears one open valence bonding . They generally abbreviated symbol organyl group R although Alk sometimes used specifically symbolize alkyl group . Saturated hydrocarbons hydrocarbons single covalent bonds carbons . They According definition IUPAC former two alkanes whereas third group called cycloalkanes . Saturated hydrocarbons also combine linear cyclic branching structures general formula CnH2n−2k2 k number independent loops . Alkanes acyclic ones corresponding k 0 . Alkanes three carbon atoms arranged various different ways forming structural isomers . The simplest isomer alkane one carbon atoms arranged single chain branches . This isomer sometimes called nisomer . However chain carbon atoms may also branched one points . The number possible isomers increases rapidly number carbon atoms . For example acyclic alkanes Branched alkanes chiral . For example 3methylhexane higher homologues chiral due stereogenic center carbon atom number 3 . In addition alkane isomers chain carbon atoms may form one loops . Such compounds called cycloalkanes . Stereoisomers cyclic compounds excluded calculating number isomers . The IUPAC nomenclature alkanes based identifying hydrocarbon chains . Unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains named systematically Greek numerical prefix denoting number carbons suffix ane . In 1866 August Wilhelm von Hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature using whole sequence vowels e u create suffixes ane ene ine one une hydrocarbons CnH2n2 CnH2n CnH2n−2 CnH2n−4 CnH2n−6 . Now first three name hydrocarbons single double triple bonds one represents ketone ol represents alcohol OH group oxy means ether refers oxygen two carbons methoxymethane IUPAC name dimethyl ether . It difficult impossible find compounds one IUPAC name . This shorter chains attached longer chains prefixes convention includes brackets . Numbers name referring carbon group attached low possible 1 implied usually omitted names organic compounds one sidegroup . Symmetric compounds two ways arriving name . Straightchain alkanes sometimes indicated prefix n nonlinear isomer exists . Although strictly necessary usage still common cases important difference properties straightchain branchedchain isomers e.g. nhexane 2 3methylpentane . Alternative names group linear paraffins nparaffins . The members series named follows The first four names derived methanol ether propionic acid butyric acid respectively . Alkanes five carbon atoms named adding suffix ane appropriate numerical multiplier prefix elision terminal vowel basic numerical term . Hence pentane C5H12 hexane C6H14 heptane C7H16 octane C8H18 etc . The prefix generally Greek however alkanes carbon atom count ending nine example nonane use Latin prefix non . For complete list see List alkanes . Simple branched alkanes often common name using prefix distinguish linear alkanes example npentane isopentane neopentane . IUPAC naming conventions used produce systematic name . The key steps naming complicated branched alkanes follows Though technically distinct alkanes class hydrocarbons referred cyclic alkanes . As description implies contain one rings . Simple cycloalkanes prefix cyclo distinguish alkanes . Cycloalkanes named per acyclic counterparts respect number carbon atoms backbones e.g. cyclopentane cycloalkane 5 carbon atoms like pentane joined fivemembered ring . In similar manner propane cyclopropane butane cyclobutane etc . Substituted cycloalkanes named similarly substituted alkanes – cycloalkane ring stated substituents according position ring numbering decided Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules . The trivial name alkanes paraffins . Together alkanes known paraffin series . Trivial names compounds usually historical artifacts . They coined development systematic names retained due familiar usage industry . Cycloalkanes also called naphthenes . It almost certain term paraffin stems petrochemical industry . Branchedchain alkanes called isoparaffins . The use term paraffin general term often distinguish pure compounds mixtures isomers i.e. compounds chemical formula e.g. pentane isopentane . The following trivial names retained IUPAC system Some nonIUPAC trivial names occasionally used All alkanes colorless . Alkanes lowest molecular weights gasses intermediate molecular weight liquids heaviest waxy solids . Alkanes experience intermolecular van der Waals forces . Stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces give rise greater boiling points alkanes . There two determinants strength van der Waals forces Under standard conditions CH4 C4H10 alkanes gaseous C5H12 C17H36 liquids C18H38 solids . As boiling point alkanes primarily determined weight surprise boiling point almost linear relationship size molecule . As rule thumb boiling point rises 20–30 °C carbon added chain rule applies homologous series . A straightchain alkane boiling point higher branchedchain alkane due greater surface area contact thus greater van der Waals forces adjacent molecules . For example compare isobutane nbutane boil −12 0 °C 22dimethylbutane 23dimethylbutane boil 50 58 °C respectively . For latter case two molecules 23dimethylbutane lock better crossshaped 22dimethylbutane hence greater van der Waals forces . On hand cycloalkanes tend higher boiling points linear counterparts due locked conformations molecules give plane intermolecular contact . The melting points alkanes follow similar trend boiling points reason outlined . That larger molecule higher melting point . There one significant difference boiling points melting points . Solids rigid fixed structure liquids . This rigid structure requires energy break . Thus better put together solid structures require energy break apart . For alkanes seen graph . The oddnumbered alkanes lower trend melting points even numbered alkanes . This even numbered alkanes pack well solid phase forming wellorganized structure requires energy break apart . The oddnumbered alkanes pack less well looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy break apart . The melting points branchedchain alkanes either higher lower corresponding straightchain alkanes depending ability alkane question pack well solid phase This particularly true isoalkanes often melting points higher linear analogues . Alkanes conduct electricity way substantially polarized electric field . For reason form hydrogen bonds insoluble polar solvents water . Since hydrogen bonds individual water molecules aligned away alkane molecule coexistence alkane water leads increase molecular order . As significant bonding water molecules alkane molecules second law thermodynamics suggests reduction entropy minimized minimizing contact alkane water Alkanes said hydrophobic repel water . Their solubility nonpolar solvents relatively high property called lipophilicity . Different alkanes example miscible proportions among . The density alkanes usually increases number carbon atoms remains less water . Hence alkanes form upper layer alkane–water mixture . The molecular structure alkanes directly affects physical chemical characteristics . It derived electron configuration carbon four valence electrons . The carbon atoms alkanes always sp3hybridized say valence electrons said four equivalent orbitals derived combination 2s orbital three 2p orbitals . These orbitals identical energies arranged spatially form tetrahedron angle cos−1 ≈ 109.47° . An alkane molecule C–H C–C single bonds . The former result overlap sp3 orbital carbon 1s orbital hydrogen latter overlap two sp3 orbitals different carbon atoms . The bond lengths amount 1.09 × 10−10 C–H bond 1.54 × 10−10 C–C bond . The spatial arrangement bonds similar four sp3 orbitals—they tetrahedrally arranged angle 109.47° . Structural formulae represent bonds right angles one another common useful correspond reality . The structural formula bond angles usually sufficient completely describe geometry molecule . There degree freedom carbon–carbon bond torsion angle atoms groups bound atoms end bond . The spatial arrangement described torsion angles molecule known conformation . Ethane forms simplest case studying conformation alkanes one C–C bond . If one looks axis C–C bond one see socalled Newman projection . The hydrogen atoms front rear carbon atoms angle 120° resulting projection base tetrahedron onto flat plane . However torsion angle given hydrogen atom attached front carbon given hydrogen atom attached rear carbon vary freely 0° 360° . This consequence free rotation carbon–carbon single bond . Despite apparent freedom two limiting conformations important eclipsed conformation staggered conformation . The two conformations differ energy staggered conformation 12.6 kJmol lower energy eclipsed conformation . This difference energy two conformations known torsion energy low compared thermal energy ethane molecule ambient temperature . There constant rotation C–C bond . The time taken ethane molecule pass one staggered conformation next equivalent rotation one CH3 group 120° relative order 10−11 seconds . The case higher alkanes complex based similar principles antiperiplanar conformation always favored around carbon–carbon bond . For reason alkanes usually shown zigzag arrangement diagrams models . The actual structure always differ somewhat idealized forms differences energy conformations small compared thermal energy molecules Alkane molecules fixed structural form whatever models may suggest . Virtually organic compounds contain carbon–carbon carbon–hydrogen bonds show features alkanes spectra . Alkanes notable groups therefore absence characteristic spectroscopic features different functional group like –OH –CHO –COOH etc . The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives strong absorption 2850 2960 cm−1 carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs 800 1300 cm−1 . The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend nature group methyl groups show bands 1450 cm−1 1375 cm−1 methylene groups show bands 1465 cm−1 1450 cm−1 . Carbon chains four carbon atoms show weak absorption around 725 cm−1 . The proton resonances alkanes usually found δH 0.5–1.5 . The carbon13 resonances depend number hydrogen atoms attached carbon δC 8–30 15–55 20–60 quaternary . The carbon13 resonance quaternary carbon atoms characteristically weak due lack nuclear Overhauser effect long relaxation time missed weak samples samples run sufficiently long time . Alkanes high ionization energy molecular ion usually weak . The fragmentation pattern difficult interpret case branched chain alkanes carbon chain preferentially cleaved tertiary quaternary carbons due relative stability resulting free radicals . The fragment resulting loss single methyl group often absent fragments often spaced intervals fourteen mass units corresponding sequential loss CH2 groups . Alkanes weakly reactive chemical compounds . The acid dissociation constant values alkanes estimated range 50 70 depending extrapolation method hence extremely weak acids practically inert bases . They also extremely weak bases undergoing observable protonation pure sulfuric acid although superacids least millions times stronger known protonate give hypercoordinate alkanium ions . Similarly show reactivity strongest electrophilic reagents . By virtue strongly C–H bonds C–C bonds also relatively unreactive toward free radicals although many electrondeficient radicals react alkanes absence electronrich bonds . This inertness source term paraffins . In crude oil alkane molecules remained chemically unchanged millions years . Free radicals molecules unpaired electrons play large role reactions alkanes cracking reformation longchain alkanes converted shorterchain alkanes straightchain alkanes branchedchain isomers . Moreover redox reactions alkanes involving free radical intermediates particular oxygen halogens possible carbon atoms strongly reduced state case methane carbon lowest possible oxidation state . Reaction oxygen leads combustion without smoke producing carbon dioxide water . Free radical halogenation reactions occur halogens leading production haloalkanes . In addition alkanes shown interact bind certain transition metal complexes C–H bond activation reactions . In highly branched alkanes bond angle may differ significantly optimal value order allow different groups sufficient space . This causes tension molecule known steric hindrance substantially increase reactivity . However general perhaps surprisingly branching extensive enough make highly disfavorable 12 13alkyl–alkyl steric interactions unavoidable branched alkanes actually thermodynamically stable linear isomers . For example highly branched 2233tetramethylbutane 1.9 kcalmol stable linear isomer noctane . Due subtlety effect exact reasons rule vigorously debated chemical literature yet unsettled . Several explanations including stabilization branched alkanes electron correlation destabilization linear alkanes steric repulsion stabilization neutral hyperconjugation andor electrostatic effects advanced possibilities . The controversy related question whether traditional explanation hyperconjugation primary factor governing stability alkyl radicals . All alkanes react oxygen combustion reaction although become increasingly difficult ignite number carbon atoms increases . The general equation complete combustion In absence sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide even soot formed shown For example methane See alkane heat formation table detailed data . The standard enthalpy change combustion ΔcH⊖ alkanes increases 650 kJmol per CH2 group . Branchedchain alkanes lower values ΔcH⊖ straightchain alkanes number carbon atoms seen somewhat stable . Alkanes react halogens socalled free radical halogenation reaction . The hydrogen atoms alkane progressively replaced halogen atoms . Free radicals reactive species participate reaction usually leads mixture products . The reaction highly exothermic lead explosion . These reactions important industrial route halogenated hydrocarbons . There three steps Experiments shown halogenation produces mixture possible isomers indicating hydrogen atoms susceptible reaction . The mixture produced however statistical mixture Secondary tertiary hydrogen atoms preferentially replaced due greater stability secondary tertiary freeradicals . An example seen monobromination propane Cracking breaks larger molecules smaller ones . This done thermal catalytic method . The thermal cracking process follows homolytic mechanism formation freeradicals . The catalytic cracking process involves presence acid catalysts promote heterolytic breakage bonds yielding pairs ions opposite charges usually carbocation unstable hydride anion . Carbonlocalized free radicals cations highly unstable undergo processes chain rearrangement C–C scission position beta intra intermolecular hydrogen transfer hydride transfer . In types processes corresponding reactive intermediates permanently regenerated thus proceed selfpropagating chain mechanism . The chain reactions eventually terminated radical ion recombination . Dragan colleague first report isomerization alkanes . Isomerization reformation processes straightchain alkanes heated presence platinum catalyst . In isomerization alkanes become branchedchain isomers . In words lose carbons hydrogens keeping molecular weight . In reformation alkanes become cycloalkanes aromatic hydrocarbons giving hydrogen byproduct . Both processes raise octane number substance . Butane common alkane put process isomerization makes many branched alkanes high octane numbers . Alkanes react steam presence nickel catalyst give hydrogen . Alkanes chlorosulfonated nitrated although reactions require special conditions . The fermentation alkanes carboxylic acids technical importance . In Reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine light convert hydrocarbons sulfonyl chlorides . Nucleophilic Abstraction used separate alkane metal . Alkyl groups transferred one compound another transmetalation reactions . A mixture antimony pentafluoride fluorosulfonic acid called magic acid protonate alkanes . Alkanes form small portion atmospheres outer gas planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune . Titan satellite Saturn examined Huygens probe indicated Titan s atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto moon s surface . Also Titan Cassini mission imaged seasonal methaneethane lakes near polar regions Titan . Methane ethane also detected tail comet Hyakutake . Chemical analysis showed abundances ethane methane roughly equal thought imply ices formed interstellar space away Sun would evaporated volatile molecules . Alkanes also detected meteorites carbonaceous chondrites . Traces methane gas occur Earth s atmosphere produced primarily methanogenic microorganisms Archaea gut ruminants . The important commercial sources alkanes natural gas oil . Natural gas contains primarily methane ethane propane butane oil mixture liquid alkanes hydrocarbons . These hydrocarbons formed marine animals plants died sank bottom ancient seas covered sediments anoxic environment converted many millions years high temperatures high pressure current form . Natural gas resulted thereby example following reaction These hydrocarbon deposits collected porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields . They formed millions years exhausted readily replaced . The depletion hydrocarbons reserves basis known energy crisis . Methane also present called biogas produced animals decaying matter possible renewable energy source . Alkanes low solubility water content oceans negligible however high pressures low temperatures methane cocrystallize water form solid methane clathrate . Although commercially exploited present time amount combustible energy known methane clathrate fields exceeds energy content natural gas oil deposits put together . Methane extracted methane clathrate therefore candidate future fuels . Acyclic alkanes occur nature various ways . Certain types bacteria metabolize alkanes prefer evennumbered carbon chains easier degrade oddnumbered chains . On hand certain archaea methanogens produce large quantities methane metabolism carbon dioxide oxidized organic compounds . The energy released oxidation hydrogen Methanogens also producers marsh gas wetlands release two billion tonnes methane per year—the atmospheric content gas produced nearly exclusively . The methane output cattle herbivores release 30 50 gallons per day termites also due methanogens . They also produce simplest alkanes intestines humans . Methanogenic archaea hence end carbon cycle carbon released back atmosphere fixed photosynthesis . It probable current deposits natural gas formed similar way . Alkanes also play role minor role biology three eukaryotic groups organisms fungi plants animals . Some specialized yeasts e.g. Candida tropicale Pichia sp. Rhodotorula sp. use alkanes source carbon energy . The fungus Amorphotheca resinae prefers longerchain alkanes aviation fuel cause serious problems aircraft tropical regions . In plants solid longchain alkanes found plant cuticle epicuticular wax many species rarely major constituents . They protect plant water loss prevent leaching important minerals rain protect bacteria fungi harmful insects . The carbon chains plant alkanes usually oddnumbered 27 33 carbon atoms length made plants decarboxylation evennumbered fatty acids . The exact composition layer wax speciesdependent changes also season environmental factors lighting conditions temperature humidity . More volatile shortchain alkanes also produced found plant tissues . The Jeffrey pine noted producing exceptionally high levels nheptane resin reason distillate designated zero point one octane rating . Floral scents also long known contain volatile alkane components nnonane significant component scent roses . Emission gaseous volatile alkanes ethane pentane hexane plants also documented low levels though generally considered major component biogenic air pollution . Edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions biogenic alkanes wide spectrum carbon numbers mainly 8 35 usually peaking low upper 20s concentrations dozens milligrams per kilogram sometimes hundred total alkane fraction . Alkanes found animal products although less important unsaturated hydrocarbons . One example shark liver oil approximately 14 pristane . They important pheromones chemical messenger materials insects depend communication . In species e.g . support beetle Xylotrechus colonus pentacosane 3methylpentaicosane 9methylpentaicosane transferred body contact . With others like tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans pheromone contains four alkanes 2methylheptadecane 1721dimethylheptatriacontane 1519dimethylheptatriacontane 151923trimethylheptatriacontane acts smell longer distances . Waggledancing honey bees produce release two alkanes tricosane pentacosane . One example plant animal alkanes play role ecological relationship sand bee early spider orchid latter dependent pollination former . Sand bees use pheromones order identify mate case A. nigroaenea females emit mixture tricosane pentacosane heptacosane ratio 331 males attracted specifically odor . The orchid takes advantage mating arrangement get male bee collect disseminate pollen parts flower resemble appearance sand bees also produce large quantities three alkanes ratio female sand bees . As result numerous males lured blooms attempt copulate imaginary partner although endeavor crowned success bee allows orchid transfer pollen dispersed departure frustrated male different blooms . As stated earlier important source alkanes natural gas crude oil . Alkanes separated oil refinery fractional distillation processed many different products . The Fischer–Tropsch process method synthesize liquid hydrocarbons including alkanes carbon monoxide hydrogen . This method used produce substitutes petroleum distillates . There usually little need alkanes synthesized laboratory since usually commercially available . Also alkanes generally unreactive chemically biologically undergo functional group interconversions cleanly . When alkanes produced laboratory often sideproduct reaction . For example use nbutyllithium strong base gives conjugate acid nbutane sideproduct However times may desirable make section molecule alkanelike functionality using similar methods . For example ethyl group alkyl group attached hydroxy group gives ethanol alkane . To bestknown methods hydrogenation alkenes Alkanes alkyl groups also prepared directly alkyl halides Corey–House–Posner–Whitesides reaction . The Barton–McCombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups alcohols e.g . Clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups aldehydes ketones form alkanes alkylsubstituted compounds e.g . The applications alkanes depend number carbon atoms . The first four alkanes used mainly heating cooking purposes countries electricity generation . Methane ethane main components natural gas normally stored gases pressure . It however easier transport liquids This requires compression cooling gas . Propane butane gases atmospheric pressure liquefied fairly low pressures commonly known liquified petroleum gas . Propane used propane gas burners fuel road vehicles butane space heaters disposable cigarette lighters . Both used propellants aerosol sprays . From pentane octane alkanes highly volatile liquids . They used fuels internal combustion engines vaporize easily entry combustion chamber without forming droplets would impair uniformity combustion . Branchedchain alkanes preferred much less prone premature ignition causes knocking straightchain homologues . This propensity premature ignition measured octane rating fuel 224trimethylpentane arbitrary value 100 heptane value zero . Apart use fuels middle alkanes also good solvents nonpolar substances . Alkanes nonane instance hexadecane liquids higher viscosity less less suitable use gasoline . They form instead major part diesel aviation fuel . Diesel fuels characterized cetane number cetane old name hexadecane . However higher melting points alkanes cause problems low temperatures polar regions fuel becomes thick flow correctly . Alkanes hexadecane upwards form important components fuel oil lubricating oil . In latter function work time anticorrosive agents hydrophobic nature means water reach metal surface . Many solid alkanes find use paraffin wax example candles . This confused however true wax consists primarily esters . Alkanes chain length approximately 35 carbon atoms found bitumen used example road surfacing . However higher alkanes little value usually split lower alkanes cracking . Some synthetic polymers polyethylene polypropylene alkanes chains containing hundreds thousands carbon atoms . These materials used innumerable applications billions kilograms materials made used year . Alkanes chemically inert apolar molecules reactive organic compounds . This inertness yields serious ecological issues released environment . Due lack functional groups low water solubility alkanes show poor bioavailability microorganisms . There however microorganisms possessing metabolic capacity utilize nalkanes carbon energy sources . Some bacterial species highly specialised degrading alkanes referred hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria . Methane flammable explosive dangerous inhale colorless odorless gas special caution must taken around methane . Ethane also extremely flammable dangerous inhale explosive . Both may cause suffocation . Similarly propane flammable explosive . It may cause drowsiness unconsciousness inhaled . Butane hazards consider propane . Alkanes also pose threat environment . Branched alkanes lower biodegradability unbranched alkanes . However methane ranked dangerous greenhouse gas . Although amount methane atmosphere low pose threat environment . .
