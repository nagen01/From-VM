The oil gas industry dominates Alaskan economy 80 state s revenues derived petroleum extraction . Alaska s main export product seafood primarily salmon cod Pollock crab . Agriculture represents small fraction Alaskan economy . Agricultural production primarily consumption within state includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables livestock . Manufacturing limited foodstuffs general goods imported elsewhere . Employment primarily government industries natural resource extraction shipping transportation . Military bases significant component economy Fairbanks North Star Anchorage Kodiak Island boroughs well Kodiak . Federal subsidies also important part economy allowing state keep taxes low . Its industrial outputs crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc mining seafood processing timber wood products . There also growing service tourism sector . Tourists contributed economy supporting local lodging . Alaska vast energy resources although oil reserves largely depleted . Major oil gas reserves found Alaska North Slope Cook Inlet basins according Energy Information Administration February 2014 Alaska fallen fourth place nation crude oil production Texas North Dakota California . Prudhoe Bay Alaska s North Slope still second highestyielding oil field United States typically producing 400000 barrels per day although early 2014 North Dakota s Bakken Formation producing 900000 barrels per day . Prudhoe Bay largest conventional oil field ever discovered North America much smaller Canada s enormous Athabasca oil sands field 2014 producing 1500000 barrels per day unconventional oil hundreds years producible reserves rate . The TransAlaska Pipeline transport pump 2.1 million barrels crude oil per day crude oil pipeline United States . Additionally substantial coal deposits found Alaska s bituminous subbituminous lignite coal basins . The United States Geological Survey estimates 85.4 trillion cubic feet undiscovered technically recoverable gas natural gas hydrates Alaskan North Slope . Alaska also offers highest hydroelectric power potential country numerous rivers . Large swaths Alaskan coastline offer wind geothermal energy potential well . Alaska s economy depends heavily increasingly expensive diesel fuel heating transportation electric power light . Although wind hydroelectric power abundant underdeveloped proposals statewide energy systems judged uneconomical due low fuel prices long distances low population . The cost gallon gas urban Alaska today usually thirty sixty cents higher national average prices rural areas generally significantly higher vary widely depending transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure many factors . The Alaska Permanent Fund constitutionally authorized appropriation oil revenues established voters 1976 manage surplus state petroleum revenues oil largely anticipation recently constructed TransAlaska Pipeline System . The fund originally proposed Governor Keith Miller eve 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale fear legislature would spend entire proceeds sale . It later championed Governor Jay Hammond Kenai state representative Hugh Malone . It served attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues would normally deposited general fund . The Alaska Constitution written discourage dedicating state funds particular purpose . The Permanent Fund become rare exception mostly due political climate distrust existing time creation . From initial principal 734000 fund grown 50 billion result oil royalties capital investment programs . Most principal invested conservatively outside Alaska . This led frequent calls Alaskan politicians Fund make investments within Alaska though stance never gained momentum . Starting 1982 dividends fund s annual growth paid year eligible Alaskans ranging initial 1000 1982 3269 2008 . Every year state legislature takes 8 earnings puts 3 back principal inflation proofing remaining 5 distributed qualifying Alaskans . To qualify Permanent Fund Dividend one must lived state minimum 12 months maintain constant residency subject allowable absences subject court judgments criminal convictions fall various disqualifying classifications may subject payment amount civil garnishment . The Permanent Fund often considered one leading examples Basic income policy world . The cost goods Alaska long higher contiguous 48 states . Federal government employees particularly United States Postal Service workers activeduty military members receive Cost Living Allowance usually set 25 base pay cost living gone still one highest country . Rural Alaska suffers extremely high prices food consumer goods compared rest country due relatively limited transportation infrastructure . Due northern climate short growing season relatively little farming occurs Alaska . Most farms either Matanuska Valley 40 miles northeast Anchorage Kenai Peninsula 60 miles southwest Anchorage . The short 100day growing season limits crops grown long sunny summer days make productive growing seasons . The primary crops potatoes carrots lettuce cabbage . The Tanana Valley another notable agricultural locus especially Delta Junction area 100 miles southeast Fairbanks sizable concentration farms growing agronomic crops farms mostly lie north east Fort Greely . This area largely set aside developed state program spearheaded Hammond second term governor . Deltaarea crops consist predominantly barley hay . West Fairbanks lies another concentration small farms catering restaurants hotel tourist industry communitysupported agriculture . Alaskan agriculture experienced surge growth market gardeners small farms farmers markets recent years highest percentage increase nation growth farmers markets 2011 compared 17 nationwide . The peony industry also taken growing season allows farmers harvest gap supply elsewhere world thereby filling niche flower market . Alaska counties lacks county fairs . However small assortment state local fairs held mostly late summer . The fairs mostly located communities historic current agricultural activity feature local farmers exhibiting produce addition highprofile commercial activities carnival rides concerts food . Alaska Grown used agricultural slogan . Alaska abundance seafood primary fisheries Bering Sea North Pacific . Seafood one food items often cheaper within state outside . Many Alaskans take advantage salmon seasons harvest portions household diet fishing subsistence well sport . This includes fish taken hook net wheel . Hunting subsistence primarily caribou moose Dall sheep still common state particularly remote Bush communities . An example traditional native food Akutaq Eskimo ice cream consist reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat local berries . Alaska s reindeer herding concentrated Seward Peninsula wild caribou prevented mingling migrating domesticated reindeer . Most food Alaska transported state Outside shipping costs make food cities relatively expensive . In rural areas subsistence hunting gathering essential activity imported food prohibitively expensive . Although small towns villages Alaska lie along coastline cost importing food remote villages high terrain difficult road conditions change dramatically due varying climate precipitation changes . The cost transport reach high 50¢ per pound remote areas difficult times locations reached inclement weather terrain conditions . The cost delivering 1 US gallon milk 3.50 many villages per capita income 20000 less . Fuel cost per gallon routinely twenty thirty cents higher continental United States average Hawaii higher prices . Alaska road connections compared rest U.S . The state s road system covers relatively small area state linking central population centers Alaska Highway principal route state Canada . The state capital Juneau accessible road car ferry spurred debate decades moving capital city road system building road connection Haines . The western part Alaska road system connecting communities rest Alaska . The Interstate Highways Alaska consists total 1082 miles . One unique feature Alaska Highway system Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel active Alaska Railroad tunnel recently upgraded provide paved roadway link isolated community Whittier Prince William Sound Seward Highway 50 miles southeast Anchorage Portage . At 2.5 miles tunnel longest road tunnel North America 2007 . The tunnel longest combination road rail tunnel North America . Built around 1915 Alaska Railroad played key role development Alaska 20th century . It links north Pacific shipping providing critical infrastructure tracks run Seward Interior Alaska way South Central Alaska passing Anchorage Eklutna Wasilla Talkeetna Denali Fairbanks spurs Whittier Palmer North Pole . The cities towns villages region served ARR tracks known statewide The Railbelt . In recent years everimproving paved highway system began eclipse railroad s importance Alaska s economy . The railroad played vital role Alaska s development moving freight Alaska transporting natural resources southward . It well known summertime tour passenger service . The Alaska Railroad one last railroads North America use cabooses regular service still uses gravel trains . It continues offer one last flag stop routes country . A stretch 60 miles track along area north Talkeetna remains inaccessible road railroad provides transportation rural homes cabins area . Until construction Parks Highway 1970s railroad provided land access region along entire route . In northern Southeast Alaska White Pass Yukon Route also partly runs state Skagway northwards Canada crossing border White Pass Summit . This line mainly used tourists often arriving cruise liner Skagway . It featured 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways . The Alaska Rail network connected Outside . In 2000 U.S. Congress authorized 6 million study feasibility rail link Alaska Canada lower 48 . Alaska Rail Marine provides car float service Whittier Seattle . Many cities towns villages state road highway access modes access involve travel air river sea . Alaska s welldeveloped stateowned ferry system serves cities southeast Gulf Coast Alaska Peninsula . The ferries transport vehicles well passengers . The system also operates ferry service Bellingham Washington Prince Rupert British Columbia Canada Inside Passage Skagway . The InterIsland Ferry Authority also serves important marine link many communities Prince Wales Island region Southeast works concert Alaska Marine Highway . In recent years cruise lines created summertime tourism market mainly connecting Pacific Northwest Southeast Alaska lesser degree towns along Alaska s gulf coast . The population Ketchikan example fluctuates dramatically many days—up four large cruise ships dock time . Cities served road sea river reached air foot dogsled snowmachine accounting Alaska s extremely well developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty . Anchorage lesser extent Fairbanks served many major airlines . Because limited highway access air travel remains efficient form transportation state . Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling construction Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport help accommodate upsurge tourism . Regular flights villages towns within state commercially viable challenging provide heavily subsidized federal government Essential Air Service program . Alaska Airlines major airline offering instate travel jet service Anchorage Fairbanks regional hubs like Bethel Nome Kotzebue Dillingham Kodiak larger communities well major Southeast Alaska Peninsula communities . The bulk remaining commercial flight offerings come small regional commuter airlines Ravn Alaska PenAir Frontier Flying Service . The smallest towns villages must rely scheduled chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft Cessna Caravan popular aircraft use state . Much service attributed Alaska bypass mail program subsidizes bulk mail delivery Alaskan rural communities . The program requires 70 subsidy go carriers offer passenger service communities . Many communities small air taxi services . These operations originated demand customized transport remote areas . Perhaps quintessentially Alaskan plane bush seaplane . The world s busiest seaplane base Lake Hood located next Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport flights bound remote villages without airstrip carry passengers cargo many items stores warehouse clubs . In 2006 Alaska highest number pilots per capita U.S. state . Another Alaskan transportation method dogsled . In modern times dog mushing sport true means transportation . Various races held around state best known Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race 1150mile trail Anchorage Nome . The race commemorates famous 1925 serum run Nome mushers dogs like Togo Balto took muchneeded medicine diphtheriastricken community Nome means transportation failed . Mushers world come Anchorage March compete cash prizes prestige . The Serum Run another sled dog race accurately follows route famous 1925 relay leaving community Nenana Nome . In areas served road rail primary transportation summer allterrain vehicle winter snowmobile snow machine commonly referred Alaska . Alaska s internet data transport systems provided largely two major telecommunications companies GCI Alaska Communications . GCI owns operates calls Alaska United Fiber Optic system late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised two fiber optic paths lower 48 two across Alaska . In January 2011 reported 1 billion project connect Asia rural Alaska planned aided part 350 million stimulus federal government . Like U.S. states Alaska governed republic three branches government executive branch consisting governor Alaska appointees head executive departments legislative branch consisting Alaska House Representatives Alaska Senate judicial branch consisting Alaska Supreme Court lower courts . The state Alaska employs approximately 16000 people statewide . The Alaska Legislature consists 40member House Representatives 20member Senate . Senators serve fouryear terms House members two .

The Supreme Court Court Appeals appellate courts . The Court Appeals required hear appeals certain lowercourt decisions including regarding criminal prosecutions juvenile delinquency habeas corpus . The Supreme Court hears civil appeals may discretion hear criminal appeals . Although early years statehood Alaska Democratic state since early 1970s characterized Republicanleaning . Local political communities often worked issues related land use development fishing tourism individual rights . Alaska Natives organized around communities active within Native corporations . These given ownership large tracts land require stewardship . Alaska formerly state possession one ounce less marijuana one s home completely legal state law though federal law remains force . The state independence movement favoring vote secession United States Alaskan Independence Party . Six Republicans four Democrats served governor Alaska . In addition Republican governor Wally Hickel elected office second term 1990 leaving Republican party briefly joining Alaskan Independence Party ticket long enough reelected . He officially rejoined Republican party 1994 . Alaska s voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect February 24 2015 placing Alaska alongside Colorado Washington first three U.S. states recreational marijuana legal . The new law means people 21 consume small amounts pot—if find . The first legal marijuana store opened Valdez October 2016 . To finance state government operations Alaska depends primarily petroleum revenues federal subsidies . This allows lowest individual tax burden United States . It one five states sales tax one seven states individual income tax state neither . The Department Revenue Tax Division reports regularly state s revenue sources . The Department also issues annual summary operations including new state laws directly affect tax division . While Alaska state sales tax 89 municipalities collect local sales tax 1.0–7.5 typically 3–5 . Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes hotel motel bedandbreakfast bed taxes severance taxes liquor tobacco taxes gaming taxes tire taxes fuel transfer taxes . A part revenue collected certain state taxes license fees shared municipalities Alaska . Fairbanks one highest property taxes state sales income taxes assessed Fairbanks North Star Borough . A sales tax FNSB voted many times yet approved leading lawmakers increase taxes dramatically goods liquor tobacco . In 2014 Tax Foundation ranked Alaska fourth business friendly tax policy behind Wyoming South Dakota Nevada . Alaska regularly supports Republicans presidential elections done since statehood . Republicans state s electoral college votes one election participated . No state voted Democratic presidential candidate fewer times . Alaska carried Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson landslide election 1964 1960 1968 elections close . Since 1972 however Republicans carried state large margins . In 2008 Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama Alaska 59.49 37.83 . McCain s running mate Sarah Palin state s governor first Alaskan major party ticket . Obama lost Alaska 2012 captured 40 state s vote election making first Democrat since 1968 . The Alaska Bush central Juneau midtown downtown Anchorage areas surrounding University Alaska Fairbanks campus Ester strongholds Democratic Party . The MatanuskaSusitna Borough majority Fairbanks South Anchorage typically strongest Republican showing . As 2004 well half registered voters chosen nonpartisan undeclared affiliation despite recent attempts close primaries unaffiliated voters . Because population relative U.S. states Alaska one member U.S. House Representatives . This seat held Republican Don Young reelected 21st consecutive term 2012 .

She full sixyear terms 2004 2010 2016 . Mike Dunleavy Governor Lisa Murkowski senior United States Senator Dan Sullivan junior United States Senator Don Young United States Representative Alaska divided counties U.S. states divided boroughs . Many densely populated parts state part Alaska s 16 boroughs function somewhat similarly counties states . However unlike countyequivalents 49 states boroughs cover entire land area state . The area part borough referred Unorganized Borough . The Unorganized Borough government U.S. Census Bureau cooperation state divided Unorganized Borough 11 census areas solely purposes statistical analysis presentation . A recording district mechanism administration public record Alaska . The state divided 34 recording districts centrally administered State Recorder . All recording districts use acceptance criteria fee schedule etc. accepting documents public record . Whereas many U.S. states use threetiered system decentralization—statecountytownship—most Alaska uses two tiers—stateborough . Owing low population density land located Unorganized Borough . As name implies intermediate borough government administered directly state government . In 2000 57.71 Alaska s area status 13.05 population . Anchorage merged city government Greater Anchorage Area Borough 1975 form Municipality Anchorage containing city proper communities Eagle River Chugiak Peters Creek Girdwood Bird Indian .
