Major oil gas reserves found Alaska North Slope Cook Inlet basins according Energy Information Administration February 2014 Alaska fallen fourth place nation crude oil production Texas North Dakota California . Prudhoe Bay Alaska s North Slope still second highestyielding oil field United States typically producing 400000 barrels per day although early 2014 North Dakota s Bakken Formation producing 900000 barrels per day . Prudhoe Bay largest conventional oil field ever discovered North America much smaller Canada s enormous Athabasca oil sands field 2014 producing 1500000 barrels per day unconventional oil hundreds years producible reserves rate . The TransAlaska Pipeline transport pump 2.1 million barrels crude oil per day crude oil pipeline United States . Additionally substantial coal deposits found Alaska s bituminous subbituminous lignite coal basins . The United States Geological Survey estimates 85.4 trillion cubic feet undiscovered technically recoverable gas natural gas hydrates Alaskan North Slope . Alaska also offers highest hydroelectric power potential country numerous rivers . Large swaths Alaskan coastline offer wind geothermal energy potential well . Alaska s economy depends heavily increasingly expensive diesel fuel heating transportation electric power light . Although wind hydroelectric power abundant underdeveloped proposals statewide energy systems judged uneconomical due low fuel prices long distances low population .
